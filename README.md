# Introduction to haskell programming.
## Based on book `Programming in Haskell` by `Graham Hutton`. 

## **Agenda:**
1. Basic concepts:
    - [Introduction](#1-Introduction)
    - [Types and classes](#2-Types-and-classes)
    - [Defining functions](#3-Functions)
    - [List comprehensions](#4-List-comprehensions)
    - [Recursive functions](#5-Recursive-functions)
    - [Higher-order functions](#6-Higher-order-functions)
    - [Declaring types and classes](#7-Declaring-types-and-classes)
    - [The countdown problem](#8-The-countdown-problem)

## 1. Introduction
- **Instalation:**
```curl https://get-ghcup.haskell.org -sSf | sh```

and paste at the bottom of ~/.bash_profile line:

`source /Users/ewelina/.ghcup/env`
 
and in new terminal:

 ```ghci```

ghci - Glasgow Haskell Compiler interactive interpreter

- **Basic Info**
    - ghci sctipt.hs - imports script
    - :reload - reloads loaded script
    - :l script_name.hs - loading script from ghci
    - :type name - shows the type


- **Haskell keywords**
    - case
    - class 
    - data
    - default
    - deriving
    - do 
    - else 
    - foreign
    - if 
    - import
    - in 
    - infix
    - infixl
    - infixr
    - instalce
    - let
    - module
    - newtype
    - of
    - then
    - type
    - where

- **Tabs**
It is not recommended to use tabs but if someone prefer to do so we should keep in mind that Haskell assumes that tab stops are 8 character wide.

- **Comments**
```haskell
-- comment that will be ignored by the compiler
```

```haskell
{-
nested
comments
-}
```

## 2. Types and classes
- **Bool:** True, False

- **Char:** single character

- **Int:** fixed precision integer (from ```-2**63``` to ```2**63-1```) going outside this range can give unexpected results, saves some memory

- **Integer:** arbitrary-precision integers, contains all integers with as much memory as needed 

- **Float:** single precision floating-point number

- **Double:** double precision floating-point number, it is similar to float except twice as much memory is used for storage of these numbers to increase their precision

- **List:** is the sequence of elements of same type, with the elements being enclosed in square parantheses and separated by commas.
```haskell
[True, True, False] :: [Bool]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] :: [Char]
["One", "Two", "Three"] :: [String]
[['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd', 'e']] :: [[Char]]
```
- **Tuple:** is a finite sequence of componenetsof possibly different types with the components being enclosed in round parantheses and separated by commas.
```haskell
(False, True) :: (Bool, Bool)
(False, 'a', True) :: (Bool, Char, Bool)
('Yes', True, 'a') :: (String, Bool, Char)
('Yes', ('a', False)) :: (String, (Char, Bool))
(['Yes', 'No'], [True, False]) :: ([String], [Bool])
[('a', False),('b', True)] :: [(Char, Bool)]
```
- **Function types:** is a mapping from arguments of one type to results of another type
```haskell
even :: Int -> Bool

add :: (Int, Int) -> Int
add (x,y) = x+y

zeroto :: Int -> [Int]
zeroto n = [0..n]
```
- **Functions that operates on lists**
```haskell
head [1,2,3,4,5]
tail [1,2,3,4,5]
indexing: [1,2,3,4,5] !! 2
slicing first n elements: take 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
remove first n elements: drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5]
length: length [1,2,3,4,5]
sum: sum [1,2,3,4,5]
product: product [1,2,3,4,5]
extend list: [1,2,3] ++ [4,5]
reverse list: reverse [1,2,3,4,5]

```
- **Function application**
```haskell
f(x)        ->  f x
f(x,y)      ->  f x y 
f(g(x))     ->  f (g x)
f(x, g(y))  ->  f x (g y)
f(x)g(y)    ->  f x * g y
```

- **Curried functions:** functions which are free to return functions as result
```haskell
add' :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add' x y = x + y
```
- **Polymorphic types:** a good example of such type is function `length` which calculates the length of list no matter what type of data is inside. Other examples: fst, head, take, zip, id
```haskell
length [1,3,5,7]
length ["Yes", "No"]
length [sin, cos, tan]
```
- **Overloaded types:** a good example of such type is operation `+` which calculates sum of any two numbers of the same numeric types
```haskell
1 + 2
1.0 + 2.0
``` 
- **Basic classes:** is a collection of basic classes that are build-in to the language
    1. Eq - equality types:
    ```haskell
    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool

    False == False
    [1,2,3] == [1,2]
    ```
    2. Ord - orderred types
    ```haskell
    (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
    (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    min :: a -> a -> Bool
    max :: a -> a -> Bool

    True > False
    "elegant" < "elephant"
    ```haskell
    3. Show - showable types, can be converted from  other types tp string
    ```
    show :: a -> String

    show False
    show 'a'
    show 123
    show ('a', False)
    ```
    4. Read - redable types, can be converted from strings to other types
    ```haskell
    read :: String -> a
    read "False" :: Bool
    read "123" :: Int
    ```
    5. Num - numeric types
    ```haskell
    (+) :: a -> a -> a
    (-) :: a -> a -> a
    (*) :: a -> a -> a
    negate :: a -> a
    abs :: a -> a
    signum :: a -> a
    signum -> it returns -1 for negative numbers, 0 for zero, and 1 for positive numbers

    1 + 2
    1.0 + 2.0
    negate 3.0
    abs (-3)
    signum (-3)
    ```
    6. Integral - integral types, fo integers
    ```haskell
    div :: a -> a -> a
    mod :: a -> a -> a

    7 `div` 2
    7 `mod` 2
    ```
    7. Fractional - fractional types
    ```haskell
    (/) :: a -> a -> a
    recip :: a -> a
    recip -> returns 1 / argument

    7.0 / 2.0
    recip 2.0
    ```
## 3. Functions
```haskell
even :: Integral a -> a -> a Bool
even n = n 'mod' 2 == 0
```
- **Conditional expressions**
```haskell
abs :: Int -> Int
abs n = if n >= 0 then n else -n

signum : Int -> Int 
signum n = if n < 0 then -1 else
                if n  == 0 then 0 else 1
```

- **Guarded equations**
It is an alternative to using conditional expressions, this is a sequence of logical expressions which are used to choose between a sequence of results of the same type.
```haskell
abs n | n >= 0  = n
      | otherwise = -n

signum n | n < 0    = -1
         | n > 0    = 1
         | otherwise = 0
```

- **Pattern matching**
```haskell
not :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
not False = True
not True = False

(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True && True    = True
True && False   = False
False && True   = False
False && False  = False

True && b = b
False && _ = False
```
- **Tuple patterns**
```haskell
fst :: (a, b) -> a
fst (x, _) = x
```
- **List patterns**
```haskell
test :: [Char] -> Bool
test ['a', _, _]] = True
test _ = False
```
- **Lambda expressions**
(`\` -> lambda)  
```haskell
\x = x + x
(\x = x + x) 2          ### result: 4

add x y = x + y
add = \x -> (\y -> x + y)

odds :: Int -> [Int]
odds n = map f [0..n-1]
         where f x = x * 2 + 1

odds n = map (\x -> x * 2 + 1) [0 .. n-1]
```
- **Operator sections** it means that function can be formalised  using lambd expression
```haskell
(+)     -->     \x -> (\y -> x + y)
(1+)    -->     \y -> 1 + y
(1/)    -->     \y -> 1 / y 
(*2)    -->     \x -> x * 2
(/2)    -->     \x -> x / 2
```
## 4. List comprehensions
It is used to construct new sets from existing sets.
```haskell
[x^2 | x <- [1..5]]

[(x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [4,5]]

-- same but different order
[(x,y) | y <- [4,5], x <- [1,2,3]]

[(x,y) | x <- [1..3], y <- [x..5]]

concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
concat xss = [x | xs <- xss, x <- xs]
<!-- concat [[1,2],[3,4]] -->

firsts :: [(a, b)] -> [a]
firsts ps = [x | (x,_) <- ps]
<!-- firsts [(1,3)] -->

length :: Num a => [t] -> a
length xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs]
<!-- length [1, 2, 3] -->
```
- **Guards** list comprehensions can also use logical expressions called `guards`. If the guard is True, then the current values are retained, if it is False then they are discarded.
```haskell
factors :: Integral a => a -> [a]
factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]
<!-- factors 8 -->

prime :: Integral a => a -> Bool
prime n = factors n == [1,n]
prime 7

primes :: Integral a => a -> [a]
primes n = [x | x <- [2..n], prime x]
primes 40

find :: Eq a1 => a1 -> [(a1, a2)] -> [a2]
find k t = [v | (k', v) <- t, k == k']
find 'b' [('a',1), ('b', 3), ('c',8), ('b', 9),('a', 3)]
```
- **The zip function** the library function that produces newlist by paring successive elements from two existing lists untill either or both lists are exhausted
```haskell
zip ['a', 'b', 'c'] [1,2,3,4]

pairs xs = zip xs (tail xs)
pairs [1,2,3,4]

sorted xs = and [x <= y | (x, y) <- pairs xs]
sorted [1,2,3,4]
sorted [1,3,2,4]

positions x xs = [i | (x', i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']
positions False [True, False, True, False]
```
- **String comprehensions** strings in fact are lists of characters 
```'abc' :: String -> ['a','b','c'] :: [Char]```
```haskell
"abcde" !! 2
take 3 "abcde"
length "abcde"
zip "abcde" [2,3,5,6,7]

lowers xs = length [x | x <-xs, x >= 'a' && x <= 'z']
lowers "aaaa"

count x xs = length [x' | x' <- xs, x == x']
count 'x' "abcdex"
```
- **Cesar cipher** 
```ghci cesar.hs```

## 5. Recursive functions
Recursion is the basic mechanism for looping in Haskell.
```haskell
fac :: Num t => t -> t
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n -1)
``` 
- **Recursion on list**
```haskell
product :: Num a => [a] -> a
product []      = 1
product (n:ns)  = n * product ns

length :: Num a1 => [a2] -> a1
length []       = 0
length (_:xs)   = 1 + length xs 

reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse []  = []
reverse (x:xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]

concat []     ys = ys
concat (x:xs) ys = x : (concat xs ys)

insert :: Ord t => t -> [t] -> [t]
insert x []                 = [x]
insert x (y:ys) | x <= y    = x : y : ys
                | otherwise = y : insert x ys
-- insert 3 [1,2,4,5]

isort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
isort [] = []
isort (x:xs) = insert x (isort xs)
-- isort [2,3,4,1]
```
- **Multiple arguments**
```
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
zip [] _ = []
zip _ [] = []
zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zip xs ys

drop 0 xs = xs
drop _ [] = []
drop n (_:xs) = drop (n-1) xs
```
- **Multiple recursion**
```
fib 0 = 0 
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n - 2) + fib (n -1)

qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
               where 
                    smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <- x]
                    larger = [b | b <- xs, b > x]
```
- **Mutual recursion**
```
even 0 = True
even n = odd (n -1)

odd 0 = False
odd n = even (n -1)
<!-- even 4 -->

evens [] = []
evens (x:xs) = x : odds xs

odds [] = []
odds (x:xs) = x : evens xs
<!-- evens "abcde" -->
```
- **Advice on recursion**

Lets consider example of `product` function
    
    1. Define the type
    ```
    product :: [Int] -> Int
    ```
    2. Enumerate the cases
    ```
    product [] =
    product (n:ns) = 
    ```
    3. Define the simple cases
    ```
    product [] = 1
    product (n:ns) = 
    ```
    4. Define the other cases
    ```
    product [] = 1
    product (n:ns) = n * product ns
    ```
    5. Generalise and simplify
    ```
    product :: (Foldable t, Num b) => t b -> b
    product = foldr (*) 1
    ```
Lets consider example of `drop` function
    
    1. Define the type
    ```
    drop :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
    ```
    2. Enumerate the cases
    ```
    drop 0 [] = 
    drop 0 xs =
    drop n [] =  
    drop n (x:xs) = 
    ```
    3. Define the simple cases
    ```
    drop 0 [] = []
    drop 0 xs = xs 
    drop n [] =  
    drop n (x:xs) = 
    ```
    4. Define the other cases
    ```
    drop 0 [] = []
    drop 0 xs
    drop n [] = [] 
    drop n (x:xs) = drop (n-1) xs
    ```
    5. Generalise and simplify
    ```
    drop :: Num t1 => t1 -> [a] -> t2
    drop 0 (x:xs) = (x:xs) 
    drop n [] = []
    drop n (x:xs) = drop (n-1) xs
    ```
